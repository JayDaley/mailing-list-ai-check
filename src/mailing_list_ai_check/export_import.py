"""Portable export / import of a list's messages and their pipeline state.

Moves everything related to one or more mailing lists — the ``lists`` row, its
pull cursor, the sender ``addresses`` and ``persons`` groupings, the ``messages``
themselves, and the ``extractions`` / ``scores`` derived from them — between
SQLite databases as a single JSON Lines file, without ever corrupting the target
on re-import. The full format and semantics live in ``docs/export-import.md``;
this module is the authoritative implementation of that spec.

Four design choices keep the file small, the import safe, and both directions
usable on a database of any size:

- **Text pointers.** A message body is static, so an extraction's text is stored
  as a pointer into ``raw_body`` (whole body, or a character span) rather than a
  duplicated copy, falling back to an inline literal only when the text is not a
  contiguous substring of the body. Every extraction also carries the SHA-256 of
  its text; the importer reconstructs the text from the pointer and aborts on a
  hash mismatch, so a pointer that no longer resolves is caught as corruption.
- **One transaction.** Import runs as a single explicit transaction on the
  store's connection using raw SQL (not the per-call-committing :class:`Store`
  mutators), committed once at the end and rolled back on any error, so a
  truncated or malformed file can never leave a half-imported database.
  ``dry_run`` takes the identical code path and rolls back instead of committing.
- **Both directions stream.** Neither export nor import ever holds more than one
  message in memory. Message bodies dominate an export — a JSON Lines file runs
  about 2.3x the size of the rows it came from — so buffering them would put
  peak memory in the gigabytes at realistic list sizes. The exporter therefore
  iterates its message cursor and writes each record as it is read (a cheap
  pre-pass over ``address_id`` alone supplies the addresses and persons that the
  format requires ahead of the messages), and the importer consumes one line at
  a time. Only the small per-file structures — the selected lists, the referenced
  addresses and persons — are collected up front.
- **Compression is a content question, not a naming one.** Exports are written
  zstd-compressed by default (see :mod:`.codec`); imports sniff the file's magic
  bytes and transparently accept zstd, the gzip of older exports, or plain text,
  whatever the file is called.

Import is idempotent and collision-safe: a message already present in the target
(same Message-ID on the same list) is skipped along with its extraction/score,
so importing the same file twice — or into the database it came from — is a
no-op.

#: On-disk format identifiers, written into the ``header`` record and checked on
#: import. Bump :data:`FORMAT_VERSION` only on an incompatible format change.
#: Version 2 added the header ``app_version`` and per-message ``pipeline_version``
#: fields; version-1 files are rejected (the format shipped unreleased, so none
#: exist in the wild).
#:
#: Version 2 is extended additively rather than bumped: the extraction generation
#: (``extraction_version``, in the header and on each embedded extraction) was
#: added to it in place, and later the per-message ``from_name`` and
#: ``raw_headers_b64`` (base64, since the header block is bytes) alongside it,
#: then the header's optional ``date_from`` / ``date_to`` range.
#: A bump would have rejected every file already written,
#: and nothing needs rejecting in either direction. New code reading an old file
#: finds the key absent and falls back to inference from ``pipeline_version``
#: (see :func:`~.store.extraction_version_for_app_version`); old code reading a
#: new file accepts the unchanged ``format_version`` at the header and then
#: ignores the key, because every handler reads only the keys it names —
#: ``type`` is the sole field checked against a fixed set (:data:`_RECORD_RANK`),
#: and no handler validates a record against a closed key list. Any *removal* or
#: change of meaning in an existing key is still a bump.

    ``date_from`` / ``date_to`` bound the exported messages by ``messages.date``,
    inclusively at both ends and independently (either may be given alone). The
    comparison is the lexical one :func:`~.store._build_message_where` applies to
    the dashboard's date filter, over the same UTC ISO-8601 column, so a range
    selects in the export exactly what it selects in the explorer — including its
    one sharp edge: a bare ``date_to`` day ("2026-03-01") excludes that day's
    messages, whose stored value carries a time. Named lists are exported whether
    or not the range leaves them any message; with ``all_lists=True`` a list is
    selected only if it has one in range.

    A ranged export omits every ``pull_state`` record, because a cursor asserts
    that a list is present up to ``last_uid`` and a partial file cannot say that;
    the format is otherwise identical, so it imports like any other export.

    written, each once (deduplicated across the whole file). Records are emitted

    With ``compress`` (the default) the file is zstd-compressed and
    :data:`~.codec.COMPRESSED_SUFFIX` is appended to ``out_path`` unless it is
    already there; the returned summary's ``path`` is always the path actually
    written, so a caller that passed ``export.jsonl`` can report the
    ``export.jsonl.zst`` it got. ``compress=False`` writes plain text to
    ``out_path`` as given. The output suffix has no other meaning — nothing about
    the format is inferred from it, on write or on read.

    Messages are streamed: each record is written as its row is read, so peak
    memory is independent of how much mail is being exported. Purely a local
    database read: no IMAP, no Pangram, no caps involved.
