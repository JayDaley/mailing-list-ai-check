"""SQLite storage layer for the mail pipeline.

Everything downstream (fetch, extraction, scoring, API) reads and writes through
:class:`Store`. The design is deliberately plain ``sqlite3`` rather than an ORM
(see the module docstring rationale below).

Why ``sqlite3`` and not SQLAlchemy
----------------------------------
This project is a single-writer CLI pipeline feeding a read-mostly Flask API,
against one local SQLite file. The schema is small, fixed, and hand-tuned for a
few known access paths (dedupe upserts, a hash-keyed score cache, dashboard
filter indexes). An ORM's value — database portability, unit-of-work session
management, lazy relationship graphs, cross-backend migrations — buys us little
here, while adding a dependency, a mapping layer, and indirection over the exact
SQL (``INSERT ... ON CONFLICT``, ``PRAGMA`` tuning, partial-index choices) that
this layer's correctness depends on. The stdlib ``sqlite3`` module keeps the
dependency set tiny (a stated project goal), makes every query auditable, and is
more than adequate for the volumes involved. Typed :mod:`dataclasses` give us
the ergonomic "rows as objects" benefit without the ORM machinery.

TIMING_VALUES = ("implausible", "suspicious", "normal")
#: Implied composition rate (extracted chars per minute of reply gap) at or

#: analysis. "empty" has no new text to time; "failed" text is unreliable.

# --- Dashboard query constants ------------------------------------------------

#: Pangram ``prediction_short`` labels that count as "flagged" for the dashboard.

#: partial AI content arrives as "Mixed" — see ``fraction_ai_assisted``).

#: defined here (no user input), so inlining them is safe from injection.

#: Matches the ``by_list`` cap in :meth:`Store.summary`, whose rows they decorate.
REPLY_RUG_MAX_LISTS = 20
#: Default and maximum window spans for :meth:`Store.thread_graph` (the list
#: panel's thread graph). The default span, used when no explicit start is
#: given, matches the list rug's last-100 window; the maximum caps how wide a
#: start/end range may be.
THREAD_GRAPH_LIMIT = 100

# --- Settings keys ------------------------------------------------------------

#: Settings key holding the Pangram detector selector every scoring run sends
#: (see :data:`mailing_list_ai_check.pangram.MODEL_GENERATIONS` for the accepted
#: values). Absent means the client default, Pangram 4.
SETTING_PANGRAM_MODEL = "pangram_model"

        A "sender" is either a **person** (a linked group of addresses) or an
        **unlinked address** (``addresses.person_id`` is NULL). Addresses attached
        to a person never appear as their own entry — they roll up into the person.

        The heavy lifting is two aggregate queries at ``(entity, label)``
        granularity — one over persons, one over unlinked addresses — mirroring
        the ``messages → extractions → scores`` join chain of ``_MESSAGE_FROM``.
        Each ``COUNT(m.id)`` counts messages (the extraction/score joins never
        multiply rows, both being UNIQUE), so summing the per-label counts gives
        the entity's ``message_count`` and the non-null label groups give its
        ``label_counts``. Each query also counts the sender's ``too_short``
        extractions — messages gated under the reliability floor, so never scored
        — summed into ``too_short_count`` for the mix bar's trailing grey segment.
        Senders with zero messages are included. The merge/filter/sort/paginate
        then happens in Python over the small result:

        - ``q`` — case-insensitive substring over the name or ANY email;
        - ``sort`` — ``"count"`` (by ``message_count``), ``"ai"`` (by the mix's
          ``AI`` share, see :func:`ai_share`), both with a secondary name asc for
          a stable order, or ``"name"`` (case-insensitive);
        - ``order`` — ``"asc"``/``"desc"``;
        - ``page``/``per_page`` — 1-based, ``per_page`` clamped to
          ``[1, MAX_PER_PAGE]``.

        ``total`` is the full match count before pagination.

        Each entry also carries ``excluded_count`` (its messages classified
        auto-generated at fetch time, which never reach extraction and so are
        never scored) and the derived ``excluded_from_scoring``: true when the
        sender has messages and *every* one of them is excluded, i.e. the sender
        can never contribute a verdict. Those senders are dropped unless
        ``include_excluded`` is true — the Senders pane's "Show all" switch —
        because they are noise in a pane whose purpose is comparing detection
        mixes. A sender with even one scoreable message is never dropped, and
        neither is one with no messages at all, having nothing to exclude.

        When ``list_name`` is given, message joins are restricted (via an extra
        ``AND m.list_id = ?`` inside the ``messages`` ON clause) so that
        ``message_count``, ``label_counts`` and ``too_short_count`` reflect only
        that list, and senders
        who never posted to it (``message_count == 0``) are dropped from the
        result. An unknown ``list_name`` yields ``([], 0)``. When ``None`` (the
        default), all senders are included, zero-message ones among them.

        when the parent is not in the window: unstored, on another list, outside
        the rank range, or a self-reference.
