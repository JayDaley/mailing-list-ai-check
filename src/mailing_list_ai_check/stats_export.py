"""One-way export of scores and message metadata for statistical analysis.

Writes a zip archive of CSV files — one row per message, a per-list aggregate,
the sender grouping, a Frictionless Data Package descriptor and a data dictionary
— for analysis outside the app, in a spreadsheet, pandas or R. The full format
and semantics live in
``docs/stats-export.md``; this module is the authoritative implementation of
that spec. It complements :mod:`.export_import`, which moves complete databases
between installs: nothing here is ever read back by the app, and the archive
carries no message content — no bodies, extracted text, subjects, raw headers or
detector responses.

Four properties follow from that purpose:

- **Denominators, not only hits.** Every message in scope is exported, scored or
  not, because a share calculation needs the messages that were never scored and
  those gated under the reliability floor. ``lists.csv`` aggregates the identical
  scope, so its counts sum to ``messages.csv`` and an analyst can verify one
  against the other.
- **Open everywhere.** Zip and CSV rather than the full export's zstd JSON
  Lines: the audience is analysis tools, not this app, and the archive bundles
  its own data dictionary with the data. It describes itself in a standard
  ``datapackage.json``, so the unzipped directory is a valid Frictionless Data
  Package: the CSVs can be validated against their declared schemas, and a
  reader that understands data packages loads them with the right types.
- **Mail-native identity.** A row names its message by RFC 5322 Message-ID and
  its sender by address, never by one of this app's row ids or a file-scoped
  surrogate. ``message_id`` is consequently not unique — a message cross-posted
  to several exported lists appears once per list, and ``(folder, message_id)``
  is the unique pair. The one synthetic value in the format is
  ``senders.csv``'s ``sender_key``, which exists to express the grouping mail
  itself cannot: the several addresses the app has linked to one person.
- **The message pass streams.** Rows are written into the zip member one at a
  time (:meth:`zipfile.ZipFile.open` in write mode), so no message row is held
  beyond the one being written. The pre-pass that precedes it holds only the
  addresses the messages in scope refer to, never a message row.

Purely a local database read: no IMAP, no Pangram, no caps involved.

One row per message, plus a per-list aggregate and the sender grouping, from an
AI-detection pipeline run over one or more mailing lists. The archive carries no
message content: no bodies, no extracted text, no subjects, no raw headers and
no detector responses. Nothing here is read back by the application that wrote
it; this is an analysis artifact.

## Members

| member | contents |
|---|---|
| `{MESSAGES_MEMBER}` | one row per message in scope, scored or not |
| `{LISTS_MEMBER}` | one row per exported list, aggregated over the same scope |
| `{SENDERS_MEMBER}` | the sender grouping: synthetic key to email address |
| `{DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}` | a Frictionless Data Package descriptor: a schema per CSV, plus this file's provenance |
| `{README_MEMBER}` | this file |

The CSV files are UTF-8, RFC 4180, with a header row and `\\n` line endings. A
NULL is an empty field, booleans are `true` / `false`, dates are the stored UTC
ISO-8601 strings, and fractions are written at full stored precision, unrounded.

Rows are named by mail's own values: a message by its `message_id`, a sender by
its `email`. None of the application's internal row ids appear. The export is
not anonymised: sender addresses and names are present, as are the real header
values.

## `{DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}`

`{DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}` is a standard [Frictionless Data
Package](https://datapackage.org/) descriptor, so this archive unzips into a
valid data package. Each CSV is a resource with a schema typing every column and
stating the keys: after unzipping, `frictionless validate {DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}`
checks the files against those schemas, and a reader that understands data
packages loads them with the right types instead of hand-written parsing.

This file's own provenance — the format version, the versions of the application
and its database schema, the lists and date range selected, the row counts, and
the detector and extraction versions the rows carry — is under the descriptor's
`mlac` key, where the standard permits application-specific properties.

## `{MESSAGES_MEMBER}`

Every message in scope, whether or not it was scored: a share calculation needs
the messages that carry no verdict as much as those that do.

{_table(_MESSAGE_COLUMNS)}

## `{LISTS_MEMBER}`

One row per exported list. The counts are over the messages in this file, so
they sum exactly to `{MESSAGES_MEMBER}`.

{_table(_LIST_COLUMNS)}

## `{SENDERS_MEMBER}`

The sender grouping, and nothing else: one row per address that appears in
`{MESSAGES_MEMBER}`. Addresses the application has linked to one person share a
`sender_key`, one row each; an unlinked address is its own sender with a single
row. A message with no sender address at all has an empty `email` and no row
here: it is counted in the list aggregate, and under no sender.

The keys are assigned in the order the addresses are first seen and hold for
this file alone — they are not comparable with any other export. Per-sender
aggregates are not shipped: `{MESSAGES_MEMBER}` carries `email` on every row, so
grouping by sender is one join away.

{_table(_SENDER_COLUMNS)}

## Reading the numbers

- `label` is the detector's own verdict, stored verbatim; the application
  derives nothing from it.
- A share must include the too-short messages in its denominator to match the
  application's own figures. The reliability floor gates messages under 50 words
  of authored text: they are never sent to the detector, so they are neither
  human nor AI, but they are messages.
- `message_id` is not a unique key: a message cross-posted to several exported
  lists appears once per list, with the same `message_id` and a different
  `folder`. `(folder, message_id)` is unique.
- Threads join `in_reply_to` to `message_id`. Most resolve directly; a small
  minority of `In-Reply-To` headers carry extra tokens — surrounding whitespace,
  a trailing comment, more than one Message-ID — and need normalising to the
  first bracketed Message-ID before the join.
- Scores in one file may come from different detector versions and different
  extraction generations. Both are per-row columns, and the distinct values this
  file carries are listed under `mlac` in `{DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}`; an aggregate
  over a mixed file mixes them.
- A reply's timing band is the implied composition rate of its new text, in
  characters per minute of the gap between the parent message and the reply:
  `suspicious` from {bands}.
  An empty band means the rate could not be computed — the message is not a
  reply, its parent is not stored, a date is missing or unusable, or the message
  has no extracted text — not that it was normal.
- The date range, when one was applied, is recorded under `mlac` in
  `{DATAPACKAGE_MEMBER}`. Its
  comparison is lexical over the stored dates, so a bare `date_to` day
  ("2026-03-01") excludes that day's messages, whose stored value carries a
  time.
