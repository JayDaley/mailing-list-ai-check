"""Fetch orchestration: IMAP selection → parsed messages → the SQLite store.

Resolves a user's list/depth/sender selection into per-folder UID sets, fetches
them in batches over :class:`~mailing_list_ai_check.imap_client.ImapClient`, parses
each RFC 5322 message with the stdlib :mod:`email` package (``policy=default``,
so RFC 2047 headers decode automatically), and upserts the result through
:class:`~mailing_list_ai_check.store.Store`.

Every stage is idempotent: re-pulling a message is a no-op (dedupe on
``(list_id, message_id)``), and the per-folder ``(uidvalidity, last_uid)`` cursor
lets ``--incremental`` resume.

HTML-only messages
------------------
When a message has no ``text/plain`` part (HTML only), we **store the row with an
empty ``raw_body``** (``raw_body = None``) — but we now also capture the decoded
``text/html`` part into ``raw_html`` whenever one is present (HTML-only or
alongside a plain part). The HTML gives the extraction pipeline a structural
oracle (see :mod:`email_reply_extractor.html_text`): it can recover novel text from
HTML-only messages and use ``<blockquote>``/Gmail/Outlook quote containers as
evidence for what is quoted. HTML-only rows are still counted separately
(``html_only``) in the run summary so they are visible, not silently dropped.

    Respects ``request.limit`` as a hard global message cap across all folders
    (the safety valve for testing) and ``request.dry_run`` (search + count only).

    A date-based pull (``--since``, or ``--days`` resolved to it) discards any
    fetched message whose own ``Date`` header predates the pull period instead
    of storing it, counting it in ``discarded_early``. The server-side
    ``SINCE`` search matches on INTERNALDATE (arrival in the archive folder),
    so re-imported or late-delivered history arrives carrying much older
    ``Date`` headers; without the discard, a pull for one period silently
    accretes messages from far outside it. Messages with no parsable ``Date``
    are kept. Count-based, incremental and explicit-UID pulls have no period
    and never discard.

    Three cursor rules apply, all resting on what a ``pull_state`` row asserts:
    that the list is stored complete through ``last_uid``.

    - Only a run whose completeness claim is true writes the cursor: an
      unfiltered ``--incremental`` run (its ``UID n:*`` search enumerates every
      UID above the cursor, and on a UIDVALIDITY change the documented resync
      rewrite re-establishes tracking from the last sync date), or the first
      unfiltered pull of a list, whose period defines the list's scope on
      adoption. A date- or count-based pull over a list that already has a
      cursor, or any ``--from``-filtered pull, leaves the cursor untouched —
      their matched sets under-enumerate by construction, so advancing would
      claim unfetched messages as stored. The next unfiltered incremental run
      covers the span such a pull left behind.

    - With ``depth.require_cursor`` (an ``--all-lists --incremental`` run), a
      folder with no cursor is skipped and counted in ``untracked_skipped``,
      not pulled from UID 0. The server supplies the folder set there, so a
      missing cursor means a list never asked for, and pulling from 0 would
      backfill its whole history. Named lists do not set the flag, so the first
      pull of one still takes everything. The skip happens before the
      ``EXAMINE``, so such a folder costs no round trip.
    - A discovery pull (``--count``/``--since``/``--days``, which visit every
      folder) seeds a cursor at ``UIDNEXT - 1`` for a folder the server reports
      empty, counting it in ``cursors_seeded``. The completeness claim holds
      trivially for an empty folder, and it lets a later ``--incremental`` run
      catch that list's first ever message rather than skip it.
